Bookdown is an R package that is used to build books, and in our case, the websites hosting CBW‚Äôs workshops! You only need to know markdown and whatever coding language you be using to learn bookdown! Note, this is the documentation to create a workshop using bookdown. If Jupyter Book suits you better, see here. If you don‚Äôt know which one to use, click here to learn more!

A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 3.4 Build the book: ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù button in RStudio IDE /OR/ bookdown::render_book() Preview the book: - updates on saves in viewer window bookdown::serve_book() Before building 3.4.1 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select ‚ÄúAll formats‚Äù if you‚Äôd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you‚Äôll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 3.4.2 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in ‚ÄúPreview book‚Äù, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["git-instructions.html", "4 Git Instructions 4.1 How to Make a Git Repo (RC) 4.2 Updating GitHub via RStudio 4.3 How to Git Clone (ISC)", " 4 Git Instructions 4.1 How to Make a Git Repo (RC) Go to https://github.com/cbw-dev (CHANGE?) and scroll to your repositories.

Select Public instead of private, as shown below. üöß Warning MAKE NAMING CONVENTION 4. Click the green Create repository button at the bottom. Now, we already have a local project. Now we want it on GitHub, so everyone on your team can make changes to the workshop! Let‚Äôs make the GitHub connection (i.e let‚Äôs add our local code to GitHub!) 4.1.1 How to Make the Git Connection (Adding your Local Repo to GitHub) After the previous step, you will be brought to this page.The only things that will differ are the name of the repo. landing page after making a git repo Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt/Powershell (Windows). Go to where we created the bookdown project. Once inside the folder with the project. Let‚Äôs make the git repo. First we initialize: git init. (Put this into terminal and press enter.) Let‚Äôs add all the files: git add * Let‚Äôs commit these files, with a descriptive message to help make it clear to others what we just did. For now, our message can be simple: git commit -m \"first commit\". (Put this into terminal and press enter.) Next, put this into terminal and press enter: git branch -M main. Important: This step is why I highlighted that specific text above. Copy that command, and put it into terminal. Generally, it will look something like this: git remote add origin git@github.com:cbw-dev/NAME-OF-YOUR-REPO.git Next, put git push -u origin main into terminal and press enter. All the steps are shown below. all the git steps typed out into terminal with results 4.2 Updating GitHub via RStudio Now, close your RStudio session, and reopen it. Now, we will be able to see a Git window in the top right. Click ‚ÄúGit‚Äù to open this window. RStudio with Git window open Let‚Äôs say we only edited index.Rmd, now we see the newly edited files. (Do not worry too much about .DS_Store and .gitignore do.) Let‚Äôs try to push this change to GitHub. Select all the edited files. selected files in the git window and the commit button highlighted Then, click the Commit button, which appears above your selected items. A window pane will appear (shown below). git commit window pane Add a commit message in the corresponding box, and then press commit below it. A new window will show up, detailing your updates. Close this window and then press Push to push your updates to GitHub. post git commit window Now, we‚Äôre done! We should see the updates on GitHub now. Also note, if we ever want to pull updates from GitHub, there is also a Pull button in the Git window within RStudio! 4.3 How to Git Clone (ISC) "],["how-to-push-to-github.html", "5 How to Push to GitHub", " 5 How to Push to GitHub "],["how-to-deploy-your-workshop-website.html", "6 How to Deploy Your Workshop Website", " 6 How to Deploy Your Workshop Website "],["storing-all-formatting-content.html", "7 Storing all formatting content 7.1 Chapters 7.2 A section 7.3 Cross-references 7.4 Chapters and sub-chapters 7.5 Captioned figures and tables 7.6 Parts 7.7 Footnotes 7.8 Citations 7.9 Blocks 7.10 Equations 7.11 Theorems and proofs 7.12 Callout blocks 7.13 Sharing your book 7.14 Publishing 7.15 404 pages 7.16 Metadata for sharing", " 7 Storing all formatting content How to edit index.Rmd 7.1 Chapters All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 7.2 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. 7.3 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 7.4 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 7.3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 7.5 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 7.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 7.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers. 7.7 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[]. Like this one 1. 7.8 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2024) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations 7.9 Blocks 7.10 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (7.1). 7.11 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 7.1. Theorem 7.1 For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\] Read more here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html. 7.12 Callout blocks The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html 7.13 Sharing your book 7.14 Publishing HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html 7.15 404 pages By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you‚Äôd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.16 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book‚Äôs title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book‚Äôs source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter‚Äôs source file.
