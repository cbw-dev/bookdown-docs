# Formatting Your Content - Markdown

Now we know which files to edit, but how can we edit these files? How do we format our text, links, headers, ...?

## Visaul R Markdown {#visual-r-md}
All our files are made up of code and markdown syntax, that becomes formatted into our website. However, if you do not feel comfortable using Markdown (or you just want an easier way to write your pages), see this guide on using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations" target="_blank">Visual R Markdown</a>.

It can be significantly easier to use Visual R Markdown, especially for those who are used to working in Google Docs!

If you want to use Markdown, a basic syntax guide is provided below!

> Is this not enough for you?
>
> Bookdown has thorough documentation for specific elements, customizations, and further explanations. For simple elements, everything is provided below. However, there are many more possibilities with Bookdown! Click <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/components.html" target="_blank">here</a> to read more!

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Now that you're straying away from CBW's Bookdown template, there's a chance you may run into errors. See [this page](#help) for help!

## Chapters

As mentioned earlier, headers are defined by a \# before the title. Subheaders get increasingly more nested as add more \# symbols before it. For example,

```         
# Hello
```

would create a chapter title. Since there is only one `#` symbol, this would also create a new page. Again, try to keep only one chapter title per .Rmd file.

```         
## Subheader
```

## Subheader

This is what a subheader would look like.

```         
### Subheader
```

### Subheader

This is what a subheader with 3 `#` symbols would look like. You can add as many `#` symbols as you would like! There is also no limit to the the number of subheaders you can have.

### An unnumbered subheader {.unnumbered}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the `{-}` at the end of the heading. For example, the above subheader was written like this:

```         
### An unnumbered subheader {-}
```

## Parts

Notice how index.Rmd in our CBW Bookdown template has `# (PART) Introduction {-}` (followed by `# Welcome`). This creates the "Introduction" section on the sidebar.

There are already 2 main parts in the template: the introduction and modules sections.

If you want to add more parts, simply paste this: `# (PART) [Part Title] {-}` into a new .Rmd file, at the top of the file, before the main `# header` for that page/file.

**Note**: If you would like to have a un-numbered part: Use this syntax:  `# (PART\*) [Part Title] {-}`

**Another Note**: A similar un-numbered part is called an "Appendix" and Bookdown. Like a part, paste `# (APPENDIX) [Appendix Name] {-}` it above the "main" header you would like it to be before. All subsequent headers will be described via letters rather than numbers. (If your following headers are un-numbered, an Appendix looks the same as an un-numbered part).

## Text Formatting

Before we go ahead with much more formatting possibilities, let's get the basics of markdown formatting options for basic text. (Tip: There are many resources online that can help give more information!)

### <font color="6495ED">Bold</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
**bolded text**
```

**bolded text**

### <font color="6495ED">Italics</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
*italicized text*
```

*italicized text*

### <font color="6495ED">Subscript</font> {.unnumbered}

```         
H~2~O
```

H~2~O

### <font color="6495ED">Superscript</font> {.unnumbered}

```         
Na^+^
```

Na^+^

### <font color="6495ED">Footnotes</font> {.unnumbered}

`^[]` is the formatting for a footnote. For example

```         
Here is a footnote: ^[This is a footnote.].
```

Here is a footnote: [^06-formatting-md-1].

[^06-formatting-md-1]: This is a footnote.

(Scroll to the bottom of this page to see it.)

### <font color="6495ED">Horizontal Line</font> {.unnumbered}

```         
---
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <font color="6495ED">Blockquote</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
> blockquote
>
> --- someone who blockquotes
```

> blockquote
>
> --- someone who blockquotes

You can put emojis to help these standout! For example:

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not push the big red button.

### <font color="6495ED">Unordered List</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
- unordered
  - list
    - element
- cool!
```

-   unordered
    -   list
        -   element
-   cool!

> Warning: Bookdown currently can not render Markdown to-do lists properly. Alternatively, use [this tip](#use-html) instead!

### <font color="6495ED">Ordered List</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
1. First item
    1. a <!-- For nesting inside a list, put 2 tabs before the element -->
    2. b
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

1.  First
    1.  a
        1.  c
        2.  d
    2.  b
2.  Second
3.  Third

### <font color="6495ED">Code</font> {.unnumbered}

There are 2 ways to write code:

1.  `` `code` `` which looks like this: `code`

2.  Or long pieces of code

    ````         
    ```
    1 + 1  # a line of code
    ```
    ````

    which would render into the following on your website

    ```         
    1 + 1  # a line of code
    ```

Find more code options and information in the [How to Render Code](#render-code) section.

### <font color="6495ED">Images</font> {.unnumbered}

The basic notation for a file is:

```         
![Alt Text](img/.../...)\
```

For example:

```         
![bioinformatics.ca logo](img/bioinformatics.ca-logo.jpg)\
```

![bioinformatics.ca logo](img/bioinformatics.ca-logo.jpg)\

Note: Markdown does not actually require the backslash "\\". However, since Bookdown uses Pandoc, we should add a backslash so that the alternative text does not become a caption for the image. This occurs when the image is not directly following or followed by text. [Here](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-implicit_figures) is where it's discussed in the Pandoc documentation!

> Note: Before adding the "\\", Bookdown will show you the image that you are referring to (double-click the file address link) and it will remain on screen, within your .Rmd file. *You can use this to double check the file address is correct.* After adding the "\\", you can double-click to check the file address is pointing to the right image (and it should hover below), but it will not remain on screen.

### <font color="6495ED">Links</font> {.unnumbered}

Links to a webpage are as follows:

```         
[Text you want to hyperlink](website link)
```

For example,

```         
Click [here](https://bioinformatics.ca/) to see the bioinformatics.ca main page!
```

Click [here](https://bioinformatics.ca/) to see the bioinformatics.ca main page!

### <font color="6495ED">Links to Other Pages/Sections within your Workshop Wesbite</font> {.unnumbered}

Note these steps work for all headers, not just main (1 `#`) headers:

1.  Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`.
    -   If you do not want to include a label, an automatic label is made: `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    -   To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.
2.  Next, reference the header in either 2 ways:
    -   If you want the number referring to your header, use: `\@ref(label-name)`. For example:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ```
        Please see Citations \@ref(citations).
        ```

        Please see Citations \@ref(citations).
        
        > Note: If you use this reference style for an unnumbered header, "**??**" will be used as the hyperlinked text.
        
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -   If you want a customizable text hyperlink, use the following:

        ```         
        See the [Citations](#citations)!
        ```

        See the [Citations](#citations)!

## Citations {#citations}

Bookdown can help us create citations!

First, tell bookdown your sources!

```{r}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

This R code created a file called 'packages.bib' (which is in the bookdown template) which is now filled with a bunch of bibliography entries. 'book.bib' also has a manually entered bibliography entry. We must tell bookdown the files with bibliography information via the YAML `bibliography` key in index.Rmd. A bibliography entry essentially looks like:

```r
@type{key,
  title = {...},
  author = {...},
  organization = {...},
  year = {...},
  url = {...},
  ... # see more possible fields at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX
}
```

`@type` refers to what type of source it is (ex. an article, book, manual, ...). `@key` refers to the name we refer to it by in in-text citations.

For example, `@R-bookdown` renders to @R-bookdown. Adding square brackets also adds parentheses once it's rendered: so `[@R-bookdown]` becomes [@R-bookdown]. 

**Note:** The [RStudio Visual Markdown Editor](#visual-r-md) can also make it easier to insert citations!

On any page that you cite, a **References** section will be autogenerated at the bottom of that page (scroll down)!

**Note:** When you cite, Bookdown also generates a citation list that it adds at the end of the last page of your website. However, Bookdown does not create a title, so on your very last page, add a `# Reference` main header. (To avoid having a "2 main headers in the same file" error, you can create a new .Rmd file with only `# Reference`). 

## Equations

Equations are written in latex. You can refer to them with a label you specify after writing it out!

```latex
\begin{equation}
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom) # the label!
\end{equation}
```

\begin{equation}
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, for example: `see Equation \@ref(eq:binom)` becomes "see Equation \@ref(eq:binom)". The number \@ref(eq:binom) depends on the chapter and the number of equations already in said chapter (the first equation will be numbered `[chapter number].1`). 

## Theorems and Proofs

We also have specific syntax for theorems and proofs, for example, this code:

```         
::: {.theorem #tri}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
:::
```

::: {#tri .theorem}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
:::

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

Learn more about styling and syntax for theorems and proofs [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html)!

## Callout blocks 

CBW's Bookdown template comes equipped with a "warning", "tip" and "note: callout blocks!

Here are the code you will use to add them to your template and the rendered output.

<!-- Specify a language so that the code formats well? -->

```markdown
:::: {.redbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**WARNING!**
:::

Write your warning text here.
::::
```

:::: {.redbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**WARNING!**
:::

Write your warning text here.
::::

<br>

```
:::: {.bluebox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**NOTE!**
:::

Write your note here.
::::
```


:::: {.bluebox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**NOTE!**
:::

Write your note here.
::::

<br>

```
:::: {.greenbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**TIP!**
:::

Write your tip here.
::::
```

:::: {.greenbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**TIP!**
:::

Write your tip here.
::::

<br>

This formatting is a div that is specified in Pandoc (recall: a library Bookdown uses to create our .html website pages). Bookdown will help colour your divs so that you hopefully won't forget to include the proper amount of colons. This ends your div properly. If you stick to our callouts, you will need 4 colons at the end (`::::`).

> **Known Error:**
>
> If you do not end your div, all following code will not render (as if your book ends with the unfinished div)!

Creating your own callouts can be difficult, and you should account for making sure both the wesbite and pdf (which uses LaTeX, so you will likely have to edit `preamble.tex`) generate properly. 

The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom div blocks to design your own callouts: <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html>.

## TIP: Markdown Not Working/Not Enough? Use HTML! {#use-html}

Recall from this diagram that all files are rendered into .html files for the final official website.

<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSf5dxJdl-7PAlIBqdqPiSxdtzFVWOUnbbPzhrTu9POTXnzJ3NvoNUPwZHh8vDQRJ3p99FTST4uXUa7/pub?w=792&amp;h=237"/>

Both Knitr and Pandoc will ignore HTML code, so if a certain part of Markdown's formatting isn't working, or you're not satisfied with Markdown's formatting options, use HTML/CSS formatting instead!

Here are some examples:

1.  Markdown has no formatting options for underlining. Hence, underline text in a .Rmd file with the following HTML syntax:

    ```         
    <u> underlined text</u>
    ```

    <u> underlined text</u>

2.  Bookdown currently renders to-do lists incorrectly. Instead, you can use the following HTML code:

    ```         
    <div style="list-style-type: none;">
      <label><input type="checkbox"> check box</label><br>
    </div>
    ```

    ::: {style="list-style-type: none;"}
    <label><input type="checkbox"> check box</label><br>
    :::
