# Developer's Guide

Is something going wrong? Does nobody know why?

> Tip: Try asking Nia!

Hi. I'm Julia. I made the initial copy of the Bookdown Docs. If you have the need to read the developer guide, that means I messed up the documentation, to the point where you have to look through the core parts of the bookdown website development to figure out what went wrong. 

This developer's guide will have the core understanding of what's going on behind bookdown.

Tips: I have a document of Lab Notes. It's rough, but all my struggles have been either documented here or there.
