# Appendix [Links for Developers]

For the developers of this guide, here are helpful sources.

## GitHub Repo

The Bookdown Docs are hosted from the [cbw-dev/bookdown-docs](https://github.com/cbw-dev/bookdown-docs) public repository.

## Diagram Links

Most diagrams shown on these docs **should** be in this [Google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/136sy6WIiSG3tBFVpHt8yQwLakB4TFJvn?usp=sharing).

### How to Edit a Google Drawing

1. Open the drawing.
2. Edit.

    > Tip: Editing size of the Google Drawing is very easy when you drag the diagonal lines in the bottom right corner. 
    
3. To publish, go to "File > Share > Publish to Web > Embed". Copy the "Medium" *(optional)* image size HTML code. Paste where you want it to appear in your .Rmd file.
4. Add alt text to the img embed code: Add `alt="Alt Text"` after `src = ...` and before `>`. 

Note: Lots of the GitHub clone/deploy/RStudio explaining images are currently locally in the repository, and not on the Google drive.
