# CBW's Bookdown Documentation

Welcome to CBW's documentation for creating a workshop website using Bookdown. Bookdown is an R package that is used to build books, and in our case, the websites hosting CBW's workshops!

You only need to know markdown and whatever coding language you will be using to learn bookdown!

Note, this is the documentation to create a workshop using *bookdown*. If **Jupyter Book** suits you better, see [here](https://cbw-dev.github.io/jupyterbook-docs/).

If you don't know which one to use, click [here]() to learn more!
