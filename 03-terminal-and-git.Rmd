# Command Line, SSH Connection & Git Clone

If you're familiar with the command line and have already established a SSH connection, continue to [git cloning your workshop template locally](#git-clone).

## Introduction to the Command Line
This is for those who have no (or extremely little) experience with the command line.

Using the command line, you can use text commands to interact with your computer's operating system. For us, we will be using it to move around our folders and to [git clone](#git-clone) our workshop into our computer, so we can work on it using RStudio!

> Note:
>
> Do not be worried about using terminal, espeically git commands in terminal! Once we are all setup, we will never have to touch the terminal and write these commands again!

[FILL IN LATER - JULIA CAN GUIDE NEHA]

- terminal (mac, unix based) vs command prompt (windows)

- pwd
- ls
- cd + `tab`
- mkdir
- rmdir
- rmdir -r
- . = current folder
- .. = previous folder
- ~ = home
- up and down arrows

## Creating the SSH Connection

We need to create an SSH connection. You have already set this up if you have been git cloning, pulling from and pushing to GitHub. If you have, continue to [git cloning](#git-clone). If you haven't, keep reading!

Essentially, we're doing these steps to update and receive updates from our GitHub repository, with security!

Follow the following 3 main steps. Each of these subheaders links to GitHub's official docs, if you would prefer to follow them instead! (Below is the simplified version of the instructions, if you've already been working with GitHub and SSH connection, consider using the official docs.) The official docs may be more up-to-date.

### [Generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key)

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt/preferred command line interpretter.

> Note: You can do these commands anywhere in your file explorer.

2. Copy and paste this text into your terminal/command prompt. **Replace the email given below with your GitHub email address** (the email address you used to sign up for Github). Press enter to run the command.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

You will get this output:
```
> Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair.
```

> Note: Output in your terminal begins with this ">" symbol, as seen above!

You will then be prompted with this message: 
```
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):
```
Press enter. (This uses a default file and default file location.)

If you have already created a SSH key and you are asked to rewrite another key, look at the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key:~:text=Please%20note%20that%20if%20you%20created%20SSH%20keys%20previously%2C%20ssh%2Dkeygen%20may%20ask%20you%20to%20rewrite%20another%20key%2C%20in%20which%20case%20we%20recommend%20creating%20a%20custom%2Dnamed%20SSH%20key.%20To%20do%20so%2C%20type%20the%20default%20file%20location%20and%20replace%20id_ALGORITHM%20with%20your%20custom%20key%20name.) for specific steps.

3. Type a secure passphrase (make up a password) when prompted with:

```
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [TYPE YOUR PASSPHRASE]
> Enter same passphrase again: [TYPE THE SAME PASSPHRASE]
```

### [Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent)

1. In terminal/command prompt, run the following command
  ```
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ```
  You will get this output:
  ```
  > Agent pid 59566
  ```

2. If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later additions, you need to modify your `~/.ssh/config` file.
    1. Check if you have a `~/.ssh/config` file: Run the following command:
    ```
    open ~/.ssh/config
    ```
    2. If you get the following ouput:
    ```
    > The file /Users/YOU/.ssh/config does not exist.
    ```
      Create the file using the touch command: run the command given below
      ```
      touch ~/.ssh/config
      ```
      
      
    3. Edit your `~/.ssh/config` file using the following instructions. (You can use any text editor you would like, such as vim). Below we use nano as a text editor.
       - Run `nano ~/.ssh/config`
       - Add the following lines to this file. (You should be able to immediately edit.)
       ```
       Host github.com
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        UseKeychain yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       ```
       - Exit nano: `ctrl + X`
       - Type "Y" and hit enter to save changes, when asked the following
       ```
       Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ?
       ```

3. Return to terminal/command prompt. Run the following command:
```
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### [Adding a new SSH key to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account)

1. Copy the SSH public key: Run the following command to copy the content of the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard:
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

2. Go to your GitHub account on the [GitHub](https://github.com/) website. Click on your profile picture (icon in the upper right). Then, select **Settings**. 

3. Under the "Access" section, click **SSH and GPG keys**.

4. Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**. 

5. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for this key you are creating (ex. if this is your personal laptop, you can call the key: 
"Personal Laptop").

6. Select the type of key between "authentication" or "signing". (For our purposes, selecting authentication is fine).

7. in the "Key" field, paste (we are pasting what we copied in step 1). 

8. Click **Add SSH Key**. 

9. If you are prompted, confirm access to your GitHub account.

Finally, we're all done! We've created a SSH connection between your device and GitHub!

Thankfully, we only need to do these steps once! Additionally, most security questions are only asked the first time, so when you work on your workshop in the future, you will not have to redo these steps!

## Getting the Template on Your Local Computer - Git Clone! {#git-clone}

1. Navigate to where in your local file system you want to have your workshop in (hint: cd + `enter`).

2. Return to your workshop repository on GitHub. <br>Find the ssh for your workshop repository: first, click the green button entitled `< > Code` ands see the drop down options. Click the SSH tab, as seen below, and then copy the text below it. The text should be something like git@github.com:bioinformaticsdotca/WORKSHOP-NAME.git, as seen below.

![how to find the ssh for your repo](img/git-instruct/copy-ssh.png)\

Then put this command into your command line, within the folder you want the workshop folder to be in.

For example, if my organization is named: jq-11 and my workshop name is "workshop-name", I would enter this into my terminal/command prompt.
```
git clone git@github.com:jq-11/workshop-name.git
``` 

4. You should be ready to go! With your given permissions, you should be able to git push and git pull fine!

>NOTE: Consider having only one team member (or perhaps your RC) make git pushes or control pull requests. To avoid merge conflicts, designate 1 team member to control actual changes to your workshop repo. Other team members can fork or create branches, and create a pull request that the designated team member can check and overlook.

But what do any of these files mean? Which ones do I edit? Which ones shouldn't I edit? How do I open this in RStudio? And how exactly is a page made from all these files??? It's time for you to go to the next page :D
