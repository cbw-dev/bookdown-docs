Bookdown is an R package that is used to build books, and in our case, the websites hosting CBW’s workshops! You only need to know markdown and whatever coding language you will be using to learn bookdown! Note, this is the documentation to create a workshop using bookdown. If Jupyter Book suits you better, see here. If you don’t know which one to use, click here to learn more! "],["getting-started.html", "2 Getting Started 2.1 Installation", " 2 Getting Started Bookdown is an open-source R package that helps write books and articles. We will be building our bookdown-based workshop websites using this, specifically the gitbook template. (This is just the name of the specific template style, you will be working in a workshop template that CBW has prepared for you!) If you’re ready to start making a workshop website in bookdown, let’s setup your device (PC, laptop)! First, let’s explain installations. 2.1 Installation Since bookdown is an R package, you will need R. Plus, our ideal IDE (integrated development environment i.e. the platform we will be working in) is RStudio. Download and install R (You need R 3.6.0+ installed for RStudio) here. Follow the instructions for your operating system (Linux/macOS/Windows). [Maybe we should have more installation instructions - a video?] Note: You can check if windows was installed properly on macOS by running the command R in terminal. On windows, –must test–. Note: We will not be using the R console, instead, we will be using RStudio! Download and install RStudio here. Scroll down to find downloads for non-macOS. Installl the bookdown R package: Open RStudio and in the console (in the bottom left window of RStudio) run the following command: install.packages(\"bookdown\"). We’re ready to start working with CBW’s bookdown workshop template now! "],["creating-rc-and-deploying-your-new-workshop.html", "3 Creating [RC] and Deploying Your New Workshop 3.1 Workshop Setup [RC] 3.2 Setting Up Team Access (Nia will fill this in)", " 3 Creating [RC] and Deploying Your New Workshop Certain aspects of the setup for workshops will be different depending on your role. Headers ending in “[RC]” are for Regional Coordinators. Headers without “[RC]” are assumed to be relevant to both RC and workshop teams. 3.1 Workshop Setup [RC] Regional Coordinators will be tasked with creating and slightly editing each new repository for each new workshop. First, let’s go to the bookdown template. Click on the “Use this template” green button, which is to the left of the title of the repository “bookdown-template”. Then, press the dropdown option: “Create a new repository”, as seen below. You will be brought to a “Create a new repository” page. Fill out the blanks as seen below. That is, change the owner to “bioinformatics.ca” [NOTE FOR TESTING PURPOSES: use cbw-dev], make it public, fill in the repository name and description according to CBW Guidelines. “Include all branches” does not need to be selected. This may take a couple seconds to generate. After it loads, you will be brought to a new repository for the new workshop! Now, let’s turn this into a website - let’s deploy! 3.1.1 Workshop Repo VS Workshop Website Now, you have made a repository that holds what GitHub needs to make our website (the basic workshop template). Essentially, the template has already been configured so that the html files that make up our website go into a folder called docs. We need to tell GitHub to look at the docs folder to find our website files and make it available to see online (a.k.a deploy it). Distinction: GitHub (ex. https://github.com/cbw-dev/bookdown-template) holds your repo, which has version control for all your files! The deployed website (ex. https://cbw-dev.github.io/bookdown-template/) has the workshop online. 3.1.2 How to Deploy Your Workshop Website In the top navigation bar, select settings. Then, go to the pages sidebar. “Deploy from a branch” is already selected, which is what we want. We must change the branch from “none” to “main”. Select the “None” dropdown button and select “main”. Then, change the folder from / root to /docs. Then press save. Great! Now we’re waiting on the page to build and deploy, which should take less than a minute. To see updates, go to the Actions page (found along the top navigation bar. This will help you understand how the deploy is working, and if it succeeded or failed. You can click pages build and deployment for updates. where to click for pages build and deployment information A successful deploy will have a green checkmark next to it. You can inspect the 3 steps: build, report-build-status, deploy. Once it’s done deploying, you can find the website at the link provided under “deploy”! A failed deploy will have a red cross next to it. Clicking through the steps can help you determine what went wrong in the deploy. Warning: A website can build properly, but may not deploy properly! It is a good idea to check after making big changes. A Very Specific Build and Deployment Warning This is a very specific (and unlikely) warning. It occurs when 1 deploy hasn’t finished, but another deploy began. THIS IS NOT A CONCERN. This is a warning message you do not have to worry about! 3.2 Setting Up Team Access (Nia will fill this in) "],["command-line-ssh-connection-git-clone.html", "4 Command Line, SSH Connection &amp; Git Clone 4.1 Introduction to the Command Line 4.2 Creating the SSH Connection 4.3 Getting the Template on Your Local Computer - Git Clone!", " 4 Command Line, SSH Connection &amp; Git Clone If you’re familiar with the command line and have already established a SSH connection, continue to git cloning your workshop template locally. 4.1 Introduction to the Command Line This is for those who have no (or extremely little) experience with the command line. Using the command line, you can use text commands to interact with your computer’s operating system. For us, we will be using it to move around our folders and to git clone our workshop into our computer, so we can work on it using RStudio! Note: Do not be worried about using terminal, espeically git commands in terminal! Once we are all setup, we will never have to touch the terminal and write these commands again! [FILL IN LATER - JULIA CAN GUIDE NEHA] terminal (mac, unix based) vs command prompt (windows) pwd ls cd + tab mkdir rmdir rmdir -r . = current folder .. = previous folder ~ = home up and down arrows 4.2 Creating the SSH Connection We need to create an SSH connection. Essentially, we’re doing this to make sure we are updating and receiving updates from GitHub with security! Follow the following 3 main steps. Each of these subheaders links to GitHub’s official docs, if you would prefer to follow them instead! (Below is the simplified version of the instructions, if you’ve already been working with GitHub and SSH connection, consider using the official docs.) 4.2.1 Generating a new SSH key Open Terminal/Command Prompt. Copy and paste this text into your terminal/command prompt. Replace the email given below with your GitHub email address (the email address you used to sign up for Github). ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot; You will get this output: &gt; Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair. You will then be prompted with this message: &gt; Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): Press enter. If you have already created a SSH key and you are asked to rewrite another key, look at the GitHub Docs for specific steps. Type a secure passphrase (make up a password) when prompted with: &gt; Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [TYPE YOUR PASSPHRASE] &gt; Enter same passphrase again: [TYPE THE SAME PASSPHRASE] 4.2.2 Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent 4.2.3 Adding a new SSH key to your account Thankfully, we only need to do these steps once! Additionally, most security questions are only asked the first time, so when you work on your workshop in the future, you will not have to redo these steps! 4.3 Getting the Template on Your Local Computer - Git Clone! Navigate to where in your local file system you want to have your workshop in (hint: cd + enter). Return to your workshop repository on GitHub. Find the ssh for your workshop repository: first, click the green button entitled &lt; &gt; Code ands see the drop down options. Click the SSH tab, as seen below, and then copy the text below it. The text should be something like git@github.com:bioinformaticsdotca/WORKSHOP-NAME.git, as seen below. Then put this command into your command line, within the folder you want the workshop folder to be in. For example, if my organization is named: jq-11 and my workshop name is “workshop-name”, I would enter this into my terminal/command prompt. git clone git@github.com:jq-11/workshop-name.git You should be ready to go! With your given permissions, you should be able to git push and git pull fine! NOTE: Consider having only one team member (or perhaps your RC) make git pushes or control pull requests. To avoid merge conflicts, designate 1 team member to control actual changes to your workshop repo. Other team members can fork or create branches, and create a pull request that the designated team member can check and overlook. But what do any of these files mean? Which ones do I edit? Which ones shouldn’t I edit? How do I open this in RStudio? And how exactly is a page made from all thes files??? It’s time for you to go to the next page :D "],["so-what-do-these-files-mean.html", "5 So What Do These Files Mean? 5.1 Bookdown Simple Explanation 5.2 Open in RStudio 5.3 Explaining RStudio 5.4 Build the book 5.5 File Setup Explanation {#file-setup} (this section is in review, Neha can try looking at the files in the bottom right and read along to what we currently have) 5.6 Push to GitHub via RStudio", " 5 So What Do These Files Mean? Ok now we have our workshop locally (on our computer), which is made up of all these files and folders? Before we dive deep into what to do with these folders, let’s explore how bookdown actually works and how to understand RStudio. 5.1 Bookdown Simple Explanation Here is a general summary of how Bookdown creates html websites from .Rmd files. Essentially, knitr renders and runs all the code, and the outpus are converted into markdown. After knitr, we eseentially have a bunch of only markdown files. Pandoc translates this markdown into html, so that we get a website! It can be helpful to know when and how these packages work, to help debug later on! Now, let’s figure out RStudio. Skip to file setup if you already know how to use RStudio (and it’s built in git control window). 5.2 Open in RStudio Enter the folder you just git cloned using Findr/File Command, it should be titled “[workshop-name]”. Right click on [workshop-name].Rproj and press “Open in RStudio”. There is only one file with this file extension. The .Rproj file is what you will open each time you want to work on this workshop! You must explicitly open the .Rproj file to build properly! A RStudio window should open up and look something like the image below. 5.3 Explaining RStudio In the bottom left, have our console and other debug related windows (such as terminal!). Any code we run will appear in the console. We can access the terminal (just like editing in the Terminal app) under the “Terminal” tab. In the bottom right, we have all of our files and subfolders. These files will be explained below. This window also contains helpful views, like “Viewer” and “Plots”. We will touch on these later. Try opening index.Rmd: a new pane will open in the top left that shows the contents of index.Rmd. This is where we will be editing our files! Notice, the “Knit” button. In your top right, we have a different window with more different views. The most relevant windows to us are the “Build” and the “Git” windows. No “Git” Window? Try closing (and maybe even restarting RStudio) and then reopening it. A “Git” tab should appear to the right of the “Build” tab and to the left of the “Tutorial” tab. 5.4 Build the book Try pressing “Build Book” within the “Build” window. Your build window is going to fill up with text, and soon, a website is going to pop-up as your new window. This is the website you will be editing to create your workshop! By building the book, all of these files were compiled and converted to .html files, that create a website. Each time we make local changes to our files and we want them to appear in our website, we need to rebuild the book. Note that each time we build our book, the files we edited will be saved first (we don’t have to save before building!). 5.4.1 Other Ways to Build Your Book Build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() Press the keyboard buttons: cmd OR ctrl + shift + B 5.4.2 Knit Your Book Building can take a long time. If you are editing just one file, you can press the “Knit” button that is at the top of the window with your file. This will run the code in the page, and show you what that page would look like in the website (as well as saving that file). Note: Other pages in your website will not update. A quicker way to knit is using the keboard controls cmd OR ctrl + shift + K 5.4.3 Preview Your Book If you want live updates to your changes, you can preview the page as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console (in the bottom left window): bookdown::serve_book() But which files do we edit? Well alas, it’s time to discuss the file setup. 5.5 File Setup Explanation {#file-setup} (this section is in review, Neha can try looking at the files in the bottom right and read along to what we currently have) Look at all these .Rmd files! Recall that .Rmd -&gt; .md -&gt; .html files (from the diagram earlier). Hence, most of the files we really need to edit or create more of are .Rmd files. However, 2 other important files are the _output.yml files and the _bookdown.yml files. They help tell bookdown what we want and what to do, especially when making our website. Everything you need to edit here is made clear in the template, so do not worry too much about getting the ride code so that your project builds! The only .Rmd that must have some configuration details is the landing page: index.Rmd. This is what fills up the beginning of the index.Rmd file, before the ---, which tells bookdown to stop looking for configuration information. Let’s move on to discussing the breakdown of the .Rmd files. Each new page is defined by a new header, which starts with #, each subheaders have increasingly more # symbols (##, ###, and more all create smaller subheaders). Try to have only 1 single # as a header on one page! (You may get warnings otherwise). But then how does bookdown know which page goes next on our sidebar? The order of the sidebar is completely dependent on the alphaetical order of the files (see your bottom right!). Our template has numbering first, to help ease our understanding. 5.6 Push to GitHub via RStudio Now, we know what our files mean and how to edit them. How do we get this onto GitHub? We can write git commands into our Terminal/Command Prompt, or alternatively (and more easily), RStudio has a built-in git interface. Now, we will be able to see a Git window in the top right. Click “Git” to open this window. RStudio with Git window open Let’s say we only edited index.Rmd, now we see the newly edited files. Changed files that need to be updated on GitHub will show up in this window, like how index.Rmd is seen above. (Do not worry too much about .DS_Store and .gitignore do.) Let’s try to push this change to GitHub. Select all the edited files. Then, click the Commit button, which appears above your selected items. A window pane will appear (shown below). Add a commit message in the corresponding box, and then press commit below it. A new window will show up, detailing your updates. Close this window and then press Push to push your updates to GitHub. Now, we’re done! We should see the updates on GitHub now. Also note, if we ever want to pull updates from GitHub, there is also a Pull button in the Git window within RStudio! Git pushing puts your edits onto GitHub, git pulling takes the edits make on GitHub, and brings them to your local computer. For example, if one of your workshop team members made an edit, you want to have that edit on your computer before you start editing! It’s a good idea to do this before you start editing, in case somehow your edits conflicts with their edits. Git pushing will automatically update the website, you can see the updates and progress in the actions window we saw previously. (Check out your website on the web once it’s done deploying!)

How do we format 6.1 Chapters As mentioned earlier, headers are defined by a # before the title. Subheaders get increasingly more nested as add more # symbols before it. For example, # Hello would create a chapter title. Since there is only one # symbol, this would also create a new page. Again, try to keep only one chapter title per .Rmd file. ## Subheader 6.2 Subheader This is what a subheader would look like. ### Subheader 6.2.1 Subheader This is what a subheader with 3 # symbols would look like. You can add as many # symbols as you would like! There is also no limit to the the number of subheaders you can have. An unnumbered subheader Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the {-} at the end of the heading. For example, the above subheader was written like this: ### An unnumbered subheader {-} 6.3 Cross-references Cross-references are ways to link to different to different parts of your workshop website. 6.4 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. The reference your text as follows [any text you want can go here](#cross). This will end up looking like: any text you want can go here. 6.5 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 6.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 6.1: Here is a nice figure!

This creates the “Introduction” section on the sidebar. There are already 2 main parts in the template: the introduction and modules sections. If you want to add more parts, simply paste this: # (PART) Introduction {-} into a new .Rmd file, at the top of the file, before the main # header. 6.7 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[]. Like this one 1. 6.8 Citations (NOT SURE IF WE NEED WORKSHOPS NEED CITATIONS?) Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2024) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations 6.9 Equations Here is an equation. Equations are written in latex. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (6.1). 6.10 Theorems and proofs We also have specific syntax for theorems and proofs, for example, this code: ::: {.theorem #tri} For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ ::: produces Theorem 6.1 For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\] Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 6.1. You can learn more about this here! 6.11 Callout blocks (will be added later) The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

We’ve made a bookdown project that builds into a website. We’ve reconfigured the output to go to a folder called “docs” (output_dir: “docs”). We’ve pushed our content onto github, and also made a “.nojekyll” file, which we placed into docs. Now in our ./docs folder, we have a bunch of html files that make up our website. We want GitHub to look at these files in the docs folder and host the website for us! We deploy our website using GitHub pages. GitHub pages uses jekyll, so the .nojekyll file tells it to no longer rely on jekyll. Now, all we need to do is tell GitHub pages to deploy (create/update the website) from our docs folder. Go to your repo on GitHub. In the top navigation bar, select settings. Then, go to the pages sidebar. “Deploy from a branch” is already selected, which is what we want. We must change the branch from “none” to main. Then, change the folder from / root to /docs. Then press save. Great! Now we’re waiting on the page to build and deploy, which should take less than a minute. To see updates, go to the Actions page (found along the top navigation bar.
