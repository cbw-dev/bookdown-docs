# Formatting Your Content - Markdown

Now we know which files to edit, but how can we edit these files? How do we format our text, links, headers, ...?

## Visaul R Markdown


## Chapters

As mentioned earlier, headers are defined by a \# before the title. Subheaders get increasingly more nested as add more \# symbols before it. For example,

```         
# Hello
```

would create a chapter title. Since there is only one `#` symbol, this would also create a new page. Again, try to keep only one chapter title per .Rmd file.

```         
## Subheader
```

## Subheader

This is what a subheader would look like.

```         
### Subheader
```

### Subheader

This is what a subheader with 3 `#` symbols would look like. You can add as many `#` symbols as you would like! There is also no limit to the the number of subheaders you can have.

### An unnumbered subheader {.unnumbered}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the `{-}` at the end of the heading. For example, the above subheader was written like this:

```         
### An unnumbered subheader {-}
```

## Parts

Notice how index.Rmd in our CBW Bookdown template has `# (PART) Introduction {-}` (followed by `# Welcome`). This creates the "Introduction" section on the sidebar.

There are already 2 main parts in the template: the introduction and modules sections.

If you want to add more parts, simply paste this: `# (PART) Introduction {-}` into a new .Rmd file, at the top of the file, before the main `# header` for that page/file.

## Text Formatting

Before we go ahead with much more formatting possibilities, let's get the basics of markdown formatting options for basic text. (Tip: There are many resources online that can help give more information!)

### <font color="6495ED">Bold</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
**bolded text**
```

**bolded text**

### <font color="6495ED">Italics</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
*italicized text*
```

*italicized text*

### <font color="6495ED">Subscript</font> {.unnumbered}

```         
H~2~O
```

H~2~O

### <font color="6495ED">Superscript</font> {.unnumbered}

```         
Na^+^
```

Na^+^

### <font color="6495ED">Footnotes</font> {.unnumbered}

`^[]` is the formatting for a footnote. For example

```         
Here is a footnote: ^[This is a footnote.].
```

Here is a footnote: [^06-formatting-md-1].

[^06-formatting-md-1]: This is a footnote.

(Scroll to the bottom of this page to see it.)

### <font color="6495ED">Horizontal Line</font> {.unnumbered}

```         
---
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <font color="6495ED">Blockquote</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
> blockquote
>
> --- someone who blockquotes
```

> blockquote
>
> --- someone who blockquotes

You can put emojis to help these standout! For example:

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not push the big red button.

### <font color="6495ED">Unordered List</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
- unordered
  - list
    - element
- cool!
```

-   unordered
    -   list
        -   element
-   cool!

> Warning: Bookdown currently can not render Markdown to-do lists properly. Alternatively, use [this tip](#use-html) instead!

### <font color="6495ED">Ordered List</font> {.unnumbered}

``` markdown
1. First item
    1. a <!-- For nesting inside a list, put 2 tabs before the element -->
    2. b
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

1.  First
    1.  a
        1.  c
        2.  d
    2.  b
2.  Second
3.  Third

### <font color="6495ED">Code</font> {.unnumbered}

There are 2 ways to write code:

1.  `` `code` `` which looks like this: `code`

2.  Or long pieces of code

    ````         
    ```
    1 + 1  # a line of code
    ```
    ````

    which would render into the following on your website

    ```         
    1 + 1  # a line of code
    ```

Find more code options and information in the [How to Render Code](#render-code) section.

### <font color="6495ED">Images</font> {.unnumbered}

The basic notation for a file is:

```         
![Alt Text](img/.../...)\
```

For example:

```         
![bioinformatics.ca logo](img/bioinformatics.ca-logo.jpg)\
```

![bioinformatics.ca logo](img/bioinformatics.ca-logo.jpg)\

Note: Markdown does not actually require the backslash "\\". However, since Bookdown uses Pandoc, we should add a backslash so that the alternative text does not become a caption for the image. This occurs when the image is not directly following or followed by text. [Here](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-implicit_figures) is where it's discussed in the Pandoc documentation!

> Note: Before adding the "\\", Bookdown will show you the image that you are referring to (double-click the file address link) and it will remain on screen, within your .Rmd file. *You can use this to double check the file address is correct.* After adding the "\\", you can double-click to check the file address is pointing to the right image (and it should hover below), but it will not remain on screen.

### <font color="6495ED">Links</font> {.unnumbered}

Links to a webpage are as follows:

```         
[Text you want to hyperlink](website link)
```

For example,

```         
Click [here](https://bioinformatics.ca/) to see the bioinformatics.ca main page!
```

Click [here](https://bioinformatics.ca/) to see the bioinformatics.ca main page!

### <font color="6495ED">Links to Other Pages/Sections within your Workshop Wesbite</font> {.unnumbered}

Note these steps work for all headers, not just main (1 `#`) headers:

1.  Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`.
    -   If you do not want to include a label, an automatic label is made: `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    -   To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.
2.  Next, reference the header in either 2 ways:
    -   If you want the number referring to your header, use: `\@ref(label-name)`. For example:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        `Please see Citations \@ref(citations).`

        Please see Citations \@ref(citations).

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -   If you want a hyperlink, use the following:

        ```         
        See the [Citations](#citations)!
        ```

        See the [Citations](#citations)!

## Citations {#citations}

***Reference*** items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.

The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>

## Equations

Here is an equation. Equations are written in latex.

\begin{equation}
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).

## Theorems and proofs

We also have specific syntax for theorems and proofs, for example, this code:

```         
::: {.theorem #tri}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
:::
```

produces

::: {#tri .theorem}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
:::

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

## Callout blocks (will be added later)

The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html>

## TIP: Markdown Not Working/Not Enough? Use HTML! {#use-html}

Recall from this diagram that all files are rendered into .html files for the final official website.

<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSf5dxJdl-7PAlIBqdqPiSxdtzFVWOUnbbPzhrTu9POTXnzJ3NvoNUPwZHh8vDQRJ3p99FTST4uXUa7/pub?w=792&amp;h=237"/>

Both Knitr and Pandoc will ignore HTML code, so if a certain part of Markdown;s formatting isn't working, or you're not satisfied with Markdown's formatting options, use HTML/CSS formatting instead!

Here are some examples:

1.  Markdown has no formatting options for underlining. Hence, underline text in a .Rmd file with the following HTML syntax:

    ```         
    <u> underlined text</u>
    ```

    <u> underlined text</u>

2.  Bookdown currently renders to-do lists incorrectly. Instead, you can use the following HTML code:

    ```         
    <div style="list-style-type: none;">
      <label><input type="checkbox"> check box</label><br>
    </div>
    ```

    ::: {style="list-style-type: none;"}
    <label><input type="checkbox"> check box</label><br>
    :::
