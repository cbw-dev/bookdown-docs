## Potential Errors & Bugs

- If you get a bug where your website builds into a website that looks like it is made using very simple html, you may have to change your permissions. If you see **"Permission denied"** in your warning messages, trying running this command ```chmod -R u+w docs``` in terminal, in the folder containing your docs folder [CLARIFY ?]

- **"Could not produce X output"** - by default, bookdown builds all possible formats: gitbook, pdf, epub versions. We only need the gitbook, so if you're having issues, change your build settings to only creating the gitbook [CLARIFY + INCLUDE IMAGES]

- A very common bug is **"missing X package"**, just install it using this command in your console (the bottom left window in RStudio) ```install.packages("missing package name, include these surrouding quotations") ```
