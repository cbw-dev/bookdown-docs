# CBW's Bookdown Documentation

This is the repo that hosts the CBW's bookdown documentation website.

NOTE:

- probably have a separate page of documentation for reusing a workshop from a previous year (git fork?)


Bugs:
- SUPER WEIRD CALLOUT LATEX BUG ??? https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html

Figure this out:
```
## Metadata for sharing

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the `index.Rmd` YAML. To setup, set the `url` for your book and the path to your `cover-image` file. Your book's `title` and `description` are also used.

This `gitbook` uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub using the `edit` key under the configuration options in the `_output.yml` file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter's source file.
```

Suggestions:
- add timing of downloads/installations (R/RStudio, developer tools, reticulate)
- add code chunk option to the file setup explanation code chunk, so that this takes up the width of the entire page?
- add border (css styling) to instruction pictures
- change callout colours ??


Potential Colour Template? (see the blue, green and red)
