# Getting Started

<!-- Maybe a more gradual introduction ? -->

Bookdown is an open-source R package that helps write books and articles. We will be building our bookdown-based workshop websites using this, specifically the gitbook template. (This is just the name of the specific template style, you will be working in a workshop template that CBW has prepared for you!)

If you're ready to start making a workshop website in bookdown, let's setup your device (PC, laptop)!

First, let's explain installations.

## Installation
Since bookdown is an R package, you will need R. Plus, our ideal IDE (integrated development environment i.e. the platform we will be working in) is RStudio.

1. Download and install R (You need R 3.6.0+ installed for RStudio) [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/). Follow the instructions for your operating system (Linux/macOS/Windows).

[Maybe we should have more installation instructions - a video?]

> Note: You can check if windows was installed properly on *macOS* by running the command `R` in terminal. On *windows*, --must test--.

> Note: We will not be using the R console, instead, we will be using RStudio!

2. Download and install RStudio [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#:~:text=AND%20INSTALL%20R-,2%3A%20Install%20RStudio,-DOWNLOAD%20RSTUDIO%20DESKTOP). Scroll down to find downloads for non-macOS.

3. Installl the bookdown R package: Open RStudio and in the console (in the bottom left window of RStudio) run the following command: ```install.packages("bookdown")```.

We're ready to start working with CBW's bookdown workshop template now!
